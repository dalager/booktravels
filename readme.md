# Countries i visted through books

Goodreads dont show me where the authors are from and I wanted to know.
So I made this script to get the countries of the authors of the books I read.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Goodreads data exported as csv
- Time enough to override the countries that the script got wrong or could not find

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
